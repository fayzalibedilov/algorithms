  1) take the root of the tree as 6  
  2) 7 is bigger than 6 so it stands on the rightside of the root
```
                  6
                    \
                      7
```
  3) 5 is smaller than 6 so it stands on the leftside of the root
```

               /   \
             5       7
```
  4) 1 is smaller than 6 so it stands on the leftside of the root, and 1 is smaller than 5 so it stands on the left side of 5
