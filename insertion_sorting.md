Q***&ensp;[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort  

1) [***2***, 27, 16, ***22***, 18, 6]  
     
   [2, ***6***, 16, 22, 18, ***27***]  
     
   [2, 6, ***16***, 22, 18, 27]  
     
   [2, 6, 16, ***18***, ***22***, 27]  
     
   [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27] &ensp; <= Result  
2) Big O => O(N^2)  
3) Time Complexity;  
    ***Average Case:***&ensp; n^2, &ensp; Normal Distribution  
    ***Worst Case:***&ensp;   n^2, &ensp; Sequence of array in Descending Order  
    ***Best Case:***&ensp;    n, &ensp; Sequence of array in Ascending Order    
4) In case of 18  
18 is in the scope of ***Average Case***, becaise it is in the middle of the array  
[2, 6, 16, ***18***, 22, 27]
